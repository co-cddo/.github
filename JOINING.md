# Joining CDDO on GitHub

There are now separate organisations on GitHub for the Government Digital Service (GDS) and the Central Digital and Data Office (CDDO).

The organisations are:

- [Government Digital Service](https://github.com/alphagov) (also known as alphagov)
- [Cabinet Office Central Digital and Data Office](https://github.com/co-cddo) (also known as co-cddo)

This is to make it simpler to manage access between and across our two offices.

If you work in CDDO and use GitHub, you should join CDDO’s organisation on GitHub.

## Join the CDDO organisation on GitHub

You can use the [Cabinet Office GitHub Enterprise page](https://github.com/enterprises/government-digital-service) to find out which GitHub organisations you’re a member of.

To join CDDO’s organisation on GitHub, you must:

- be in CDDO
- have an existing or new GitHub account

Before you can join, you must:

- [set up multi-factor authentication (MFA)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication)
- [add your digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk email address](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/verifying-your-email-address) as your GitHub account’s primary or additional email address
- [verify your email address](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/verifying-your-email-address)

Ask to become a member of CDDO’s organisation on GitHub by either:

- posting a message on the #cddo-github Slack channel
- emailing [co-cddo-github-admin@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:co-cddo-github-admin@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk)

If you were already a member of the GDS organisation, you’ll remain a member for now.

## Transferring a repository from GDS to CDDO

Find out how to [transfer a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/transferring-a-repository) on GitHub’s website.

Some teams have already transferred their repositories. For example, the Data Standards Authority team have moved their [open-standards](https://github.com/co-cddo/open-standards) and [Federated API Discovery Model](https://github.com/co-cddo/federated-api-model) repositories from GDS to CDDO.

There’s no deadline for transferring a repository from GDS to CDDO.

## Creating a new repository

If you’re a CDDO staff member, you must create new repositories under the CDDO organisation.

You must follow the guidance on:

- [storing source code](https://gds-way.cloudapps.digital/standards/source-code.html#publish-open-source-code) from The GDS Way
- [making source code open and reusable](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/making-source-code-open-and-reusable) from the Service Manual

Give your new repository a name that fully describes what it is, for example aws-route53-parked-govuk-domain.
